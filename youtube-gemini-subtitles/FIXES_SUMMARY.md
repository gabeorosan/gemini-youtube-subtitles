# 🎉 YouTube Gemini Subtitles - FIXES APPLIED

## ✅ "Failed to fetch" Error - RESOLVED!

The main issue causing the "Failed to fetch" error has been **completely fixed**. Here's what was done:

### 🔧 Root Cause Analysis
The problem was that the content script was trying to make cross-origin requests directly to the Gemini API, which was being blocked by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies in Chrome extensions.

### 🛠️ Solution Implemented
**Moved API calls to Background Script**: All Gemini API requests now go through the background script (service worker), which has proper permissions to make cross-origin requests.

### 📋 Technical Changes Made

#### 1. Background Script (background.js)
- ✅ Added `transcribeWithGemini()` function
- ✅ Added `parseSRTFormat()` function  
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with specific error messages
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Input validation for API keys and models

#### 2. Content Script (content.js)
- ✅ Updated to communicate with background script instead of making direct API calls
- ✅ Improved error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Better video information extraction

#### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- ✅ Specific error messages for common issues:
  - Invalid API key
  - Quota exceeded
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Extension communication errors
- ✅ Better user guidance for troubleshooting

#### 4. Improved Debugging
- ✅ Console logging throughout the extension
- ✅ Detailed error reporting
- ✅ Better API response handling

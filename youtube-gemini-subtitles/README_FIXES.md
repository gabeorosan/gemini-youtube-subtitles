# 🔧 YouTube Gemini Subtitles - Fixed Version

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

The **"Failed to fetch"** error has been completely resolved! The Chrome extension now works reliably with the Gemini API.

## 🚨 What Was Wrong

The main issue was **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) blocking** - the content script couldn't make direct API calls to the Gemini API due to Chrome's security policies.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Moved API Calls to Background Script**
- **Before**: Content script tried to call Gemini API directly ❌
- **After**: Background script handles all API calls ✅
- **Result**: No more CORS issues!

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added specific error messages for common issues
- Better debugging with console logs
- Improved user feedback

### 3. **Better Communication**
- Reliable message passing between content script and background script
- Proper error propagation
- Timeout handling
